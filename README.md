# OAuth-Infrz
Single-Sign-On solution for ActiveDirectory of "Informatik Rechenzentrum" at Uni Hamburg.

# OAuth
## How OAuth2 works
The following diagram and text explains *my* implementation of the OAuth2 protocol.
Although I have tried to conform to the protocols conventions the details to different implementations may vary.

![OAuth2 process](doc/oauth2_process.png)

1. The user wants to use a client site.
 * **GET** `https://client-site.org/service`
2. The client site informs the user about the authorization request and redirects her to the authorization request page on the OAuth2 Infrz site.
 * **GET** `https://my-oauth-server.edu/authorize?client_id={cid}&redirect_uri={ru}`
3. After the user logs in to the OAuth Infrz service, it confirms the users identity by checking his "Informatik Rechenzentrum" (*irz*) credentials against the *ActiveDirectory* (*LDAP*).
4. *LDAP* confirms the credentials and answers with the user information.
5. After the user accepts the authorization on the OAuth Infrz site she is redirected to the client site passing an *auth_code* through a **GET** variable.
 * **GET** `https://client-site.org/client/redirect/page?code={auth_code}`
6. Now that the client has a valid *auth_code* it can exchange it for an *access_token*.
 * **POST** `https://my-oauth-server.edu/authorize/token?grant_type={gt}client_id={cid}&client_secret={cs}&code={auth_code}&redirect_uri={ru}`
7. The server returns the client an *access_token* as a *JSON* encoded object.
 * At this point it is proven to the client that the user has an *irz* account and therefore is a member of the department.
8. The client requests user information from the server with his *access_token*.
 * **GET** `https://my-oauth-server.edu/user?access_token={access_token}`
9. The server answers with the *JSON* encoded user object.
10. The client provides its services to the user.

# Installation
To install this package simply clone this project and set up a web-server. there is a sample nginx-config in the `doc` folder.

## Dependencies
* __twig/twig__: _"1.*"_

### Installing dependencies
To install all dependencies, run `php composer.phar install` in your shell from the main directory.

# Valid Calls
## Web-Page
Web-Page calls return their information as a HTML web page.
Keep in mind that all url-values have to be *urlencoded* when passed. All POST-calls (except for "/login/authorize") must have a valid *page_token* set.
* **GET "/":** The main page with informational text.
* **GET "/login?redirect={r}":** The login form to be used with ActiveDirectory-Credentials.
 * *redirect*: The url to which the user is redirected after successful login.
* **POST "/login/authorize?username={un}&password={pw}&redirect={r}":** The login call, displaying status on login call and redirecting on success.
 * *username*: The infrz kennung from the user.
 * *password*: The password to the Infrz account.
 * *redirect*: The url to which the user is redirected after successful login.
* **GET "/authorize?client_id={cid}&redirect_uri={ru}":** Authorize form displaying information about the client and scope.
 * *client_id*: The *client_id* of the client requesting an authorization.
 * *redirect_uri*: The url to which the user is redirected after successful permission grant.
 * The *response_type* variable (from the OAuth2 specification) is intentionally being ignored. The response-type at this stage is *code*.
* **POST "/authorize/grant?client_id{cid}&redirect_uri={ru}&scope={s}":** Displaying information about the access grant and redirecting to client-site with *auth_code*.
 * *client_id*: The *client_id* of the client requesting an authorization.
 * *redirect_uri*: The url to which the user is redirected after successful permission grant.
 * *scope*: The *scope* which was granted by the user.
* **GET "/client"**: The client overview displays a list of all clients the currently logged in user manages.
 * The client module (and all its actions) is only accessible if the user has permissions to manage clients.
* **GET "/client/new"**: The form to register a new client.
* **POST "/client/register?name={n}&description={d}&host={Ä§}&redirect_uri={ru}&scope={ds}"**: The actual call to register a new client.
 * *name*: The name of the new client.
 * *description*: A brief description of the new client and its functionality/purpose.
 * *host*: The host from which the client calls are allowed (either IP or Hostname). Multiple hosts are separated with a comma.
 * *redirect_uri*: The url to which the user is redirected after authorization.
 * *scope*: The *scope* which the client is requesting by default.
* **GET "/client/_{id}"**: The object page to the *client* with the given id.
* **GET "/client/_{id}/edit"**: The edit page to the *client* with the given id.
* **POST "/client/_{id}/save?name={n}&description={d}&host={h}&redirect_uri={ru}&scope={ds}"**: The save action to the *client* with the given id.
 * *name*: The name of the new client.
 * *description*: A brief description of the new client and its functionality/purpose.
 * *host*: The host from which client calls are allowed (either IP or Hostname). Multiple hosts are separated with a comma.
 * *redirect_uri*: The url to which the user is redirected after authorization.
 * *scope*: The *scope* which the client is requesting by default.
* **POST "/client/_{id}/delete"**: Deletes the *client* with the given id.
* **POST "/client/_{id}/new_credentials"**: Generates und updates new client_id and client_secret (credentials).

## REST
REST calls return their information as a JSON encoded string.
* **POST "/authorize/token?grant_type={gt}&client_id={cid}&client_secret={cs}&code={c}&redirect_uri={ru}"**: Returns a new authorization token ( *access_token* ) if the call is valid.
 * *grant_type*: The *grant_type* (from OAuth2 specification) which is being used. The value has to be *authorization_code* or *refresh_token*.
 * *client_id*: The *client_id* from the requesting client.
 * *client_secret*: The *client_secret* mathing to the client_id.
 * *code*: Either the *verification code* from the user or a valid *refresh_token*, depending on *grant_type*-setting.
 * *redirect_uri*: The url to which the user gets forwarded after successful permission grant.
* **GET "/user?access_token={at}"**: Returns the user-information.
 * *access_token*: The valid *access_token* from the client.
